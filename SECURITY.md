# Security Policy

## Should I use this Software?

NO!
STAY AWAY!
This is a learners project and is likely to be full of errors and to be abandoned in a few weeks.
There are surely more secure, better made projects out there.

## Supported Versions

None.

This project is made for a course we are taking. 
We are newbies trying to learn, so there is not yet such a thing as a supported release and there might never be one. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found one, we are not surprised, but still would appreaciate a heads up.
Just open an issue and give us as much information as you can. 
(If this were a serious project, we would set up an email account, so you can contact us and we can open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories).
And use a disclaimer like this:
SSE_Notes values the members of the independent security research community who find security vulnerabilities and work with our team so that proper fixes can be issued to users. Our policy is to credit all researchers in the fix's release notes. In order to receive credit, security researchers must follow responsible disclosure practices, including:

    They do not publish the vulnerability prior to the Directus team releasing a fix for it
    They do not divulge exact details of the issue, for example, through exploits or proof-of-concepts

)

But this repo is mainly used for learning, and so a simple, public issue is going to endanger nobody.
