# Why this package?
We needed a webframe work for our application. Express is trusted and has enough functions to work well for creating an app.<br>
It might not be as small or self-contained as react, but in regard to the limited time-scope of the project, using an already known package seemed saver.<br>
express is such a well-known and trusted framework that using it feels very low risk.<br>
