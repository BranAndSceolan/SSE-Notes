# General statement

Because development dependencies are not used in production, they generally do not cause security issues in the deployed application later.<br>
Therefore, vulnerabilities are much less of a problem here. <br>
Still, there were some dependencies we had written an evaluation for before we realised that making them dev dependencies would not be harmful, so we kept those evaluations.
